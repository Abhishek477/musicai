This python program will automatically download latest songs in your desktop.
I am starting it by web crawling 'songs.pk'.
We need to make a directory named 'songspk_single' on the same folder where main_prog.py is.
Modules used are:-
(requests
,bs4--modified version of BeautifulSoup module--,
,urllib,
os.path).
Contribute and have fun.
