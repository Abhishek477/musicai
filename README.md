#This python program will automatically download latest songs in your desktop\n
I am starting it by web crawling 'songs.pk'\n
We need to make a directory named 'songspk_single' on the same folder where is main_prog.py\n
Modules used are:-
(requests
,bs4--modified version of BeautifulSoup module--,
,urllib,
os.path)\n
Contribute and have fun.
